# Auction-House
A CLI Auction House made for the purposes of practicing Object Oriented Programming in C#. You can use credentials (just fake them! No info is stored in a DB) to register a product for auction. To showcase this, create a different user and login to search for your product by name and bid on it! Don't worry, it's not an actual bid.
